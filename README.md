This is the code for my personal website. 
I am making this, as I wanted to build a website from scratch. 
I took Internet Programming in Fall 2015 and I have wanted to build a personal website since then. Another reason for
building this website is so that I can learn and appreciate CSS and styling in general. 

For the initial version of the website I will be using HTML, CSS, PHP and a little bit of JavaScript. 
After I complete this initial version, I want to start using React for my front end, and Node.js for my back end. I have no experience
in the 2, so hopefully by building this website I can learn a lot more.
